# Firmware for BigClown RF Test firmware

You need both parties, TX and RX. Please see the other repository for counterpart firmware.

TX hardware: just Core Module
RX hardware: Core Module, LCD module to display stats

Also the battery modules are necessary if you don't want power by USB.
For the best results dont use the micro battery module, which has battery contacts too close to the antenna. Or at least insert some another module between mini battery module and Core Module
